CAN-Communication-for-EV-
📌 Project Overview This project demonstrates a CAN (Controller Area Network) based communication system used in Electric Vehicles. Multiple Electronic Control Units (ECUs) communicate over a common CAN bus to exchange real-time vehicle data.

🔧 Project Features Multi-node CAN communication Real-time transmission of EV parameters Battery Temperature monitoring State of Charge (SOC) display Seatbelt status indication Live data display on LCD dashboard

🧩 Hardware Used Arduino Uno / Nano MCP2515 CAN Controller with Transceiver LCD / OLED Display Sensors and switches CAN bus with proper termination

📡 Communication Details Protocol: CAN 2.0 Baud Rate: 500 kbps Frame Type: Standard (11-bit ID) Multi-node CAN architecture

🎯 Key Learnings Understanding of automotive CAN protocol Multi-node embedded system design Real-time data handling Basics of EV communication systems

🚀 Future Improvements Motor controller integration Fault detection and diagnostics CAN data logging
